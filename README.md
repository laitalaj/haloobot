# haloobot

A Telegram bot that automates meme spouting.

Quickstart:

1. Get yourself Python 3.5+
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and mpg123, vorbis-tools, fortune and cowsay with a package manager of your choice (or by some other method, as long as they can be used from command line)
3. Create a bot and get yourself a bot API key with @BotFather
  * Make sure to disable group privacy for your bot while you're at it (haloobot won't work otherwise!)
4. Create a file called 'haloosettings' with contents somewhat like this:
  * `name = <the username of your bot without the @ symbol>`
  * `key = <your Telegram bot API key>`
  * `password = <password for bot owner specific commands>`
5. Run haloobot.py
6. Add the bot to some conversation
7. Give haloobot a `/breaksilence "password"`
(the password for breaking initial silence is printed in the stdout)
to break initial silence and then go for `/listcommands`

I might document this a bit more someday. Maybe.

I'm sorry.
